My friends and I created this website as part of our assignment for our Computing Technology Inquiry Project.


The requirements were to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL to create a fully functional website that conencts to a database to store customers' data and managers' login info to allow for management of customers' data.
